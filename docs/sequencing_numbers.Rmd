```

```{r choose_extracts}
to_sequence <- combined_data %>%
  # Get rid of Upper Edington as we it has two lighting types. Also specify
  # that we want to keep control: as it has na values for SiteName and 
  # location_type, it will get filtered out if we don't explicitly keep it
  filter(Sample.Unique.ID == 'CONTROL' | SiteName != "Upper Edington") %>% 
  # also remove LPS, whilst keeping the control
  filter(Sample.Unique.ID == 'CONTROL' | location_type != 'LPS') 

summary_to_seq <- to_sequence %>%
  group_by(location_type, SiteLampType) %>%
  summarise(`Number of extracts` = n())

kable(summary_to_seq, caption = 'Treatments of the spiders to sequence')
```


```{r}
n_spiders <- nrow(to_sequence)
```
We have `r n_spiders` samples, including the extraction control.

```{r}
# the number of extracts we NEED to plate per primer ,
n_extracts <- n_spiders * 2
```
For our experiment we want to use 2 primer pairs per spider (ZBJ and ANML). So we need to use `r n_extracts` wells as a minimum.

```{r}
wells_per_plate <- 95

# the number of plates (to a decimal) that we'll need for each primer pair
n_plates_per_primer <- n_spiders / wells_per_plate

# The number of wells that we're going to need to fill up 
max_wells <- ceiling(n_plates_per_primer) * wells_per_plate

to_fill <- max_wells - n_spiders

```

Things are made more difficult as we shouldn't mix primers on a plate. So we'll have a lot of empty wells to fill out per primer set, as we only need to use `r round(n_plates_per_primer, digits = 2)` plates per primer set, leaving `r to_fill` wells empty. We'll have to use at least `r ceiling(n_plates_per_primer)` plates per primer set, and then fill the empty wells with PCR replicates. 

```{r}
n_ZBJ_plates <- 4
ZBJ_samples <- n_ZBJ_plates * 95
ZBJ_replicates <- ZBJ_samples - n_spiders
n_ANML_plates <- 5
ANML_samples <- n_ANML_plates * 95
ANML_replicates <- ANML_samples - n_spiders

```

It looks like we may as well fill `r n_ZBJ_plates` plates with samples for ZBJ, and `r n_ANML_plates` plates with ANML.
This will give `r ZBJ_samples` wells with samples for ZBJ, and `r 5*95` wells with ANML. This means that we have to include `r ZBJ_replicates` PCR replicates of ZBJ and `r ANML_replicates` PCR replicates of ANML. This will give lots of replicates of ANML, which allows some insight into how effective (or not) PCR replicates are.


```{r}
# Add the number of extracts to be sequenced per spider for each primer pair
conc_order <- order(to_sequence$BDNA.Conc.ng.uL, decreasing = T)
to_sequence$n_ANML <- 1
to_sequence$n_ANML[conc_order[1:ANML_replicates]] <- 2
to_sequence$n_ZBJ <- 1
to_sequence$n_ZBJ[conc_order[1:ZBJ_replicates]] <- 2

# rearrange column orders
to_sequence <- to_sequence %>%
  select(n_ANML, n_ZBJ, everything())

write.csv(to_sequence, here('data', 'to_sequence.csv'),
          row.names = F)

```
